\contentsline {added}{Added~(harry): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ In addition to accuracy test, efficiency of the current method is compared with a 2nd order counterpart. The 2nd order test uses 2nd order FV and 2nd order trapezoid rule time marching. In the 2nd order scheme, the face flux integration uses midpoint rule. All positivity preserving algorithms are in the same form. All the tests are conducted on the same machine with the same parameters, and wall time is recorded for each test run. Figure \ref {fig:IVeff} displays convergence and efficiency of the 2nd and 4th order methods. $N_x$ in Figure \ref {fig:IVeff} means number of grids in one direction, or $10/h$ in other words. In Figure \ref {fig:IVeff}(a), the 4th order method displays 4th or higher order of accuracy, while the 2nd order method displays 2nd order accuracy. On the same $160\times 160$ grid, 4th order method produces only less than $1/100$ of the error 2nd order method produces. Figure \ref {fig:IVeff}(b) indicates the efficiency of 4th order methods overtakes that of 2nd when the error demand is strict. When $10^-4$ density error is needed, 2nd order method uses less time, but when $10^-6$ density error is needed, 4th order method uses significantly less time. Therefore, it is demonstrated in the isentropic vortex test that high order positivity preserving methods has two advantages: (1) high order methods can resolve the same structure better on the same grid; (2) high order methods consumes less time when demanding small error. }}{18}{section*.5}%

\contentsline {added}{Added~(harry): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ The Le Blanc shock tube problem is a one-dimensional Riemann problem described by the Euler equations and generates an extremely strong shockwave \cite {toro2013riemann}. As a result, the Le Blanc problem is often used as a test case for positivity preserving schemes \cite {hu2013positivity, chan2021positivity, huang2024general}. The initial conditions are listed in Eq.\eqref {eq:leBlancCond}. }}{18}{section*.9}%
\contentsline {added}{Added~(harry): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ The ratio of specific heat is $\gamma = 5/3$. The computational domain is in $[0,9]$, partitioned into $N=800$ or $N=3200$ uniform cells. In each inner iteration, the CFL number for local pseudo time step $\text {CFL}_\tau $ is initiated as $0.5$ and increased gradually up to its maximum $10$ at the 10th iteration. The convergence criterion for inner iteration is that the norm of residual decreases by 3 orders of magnitude. For both the $N=800$ and $3200$ grids, two simulations are performed up to $t=6$ using $\mathrm \Delta t_{max} = 0.01$ and $\mathrm \Delta t_{max} = 0.1$ respectively. }}{18}{section*.10}%
\contentsline {added}{Added~(harry): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ The numerical results of the two simulations are shown in Figure \ref {fig:leBlanc}. It can be observed that the numerical solutions with both time step sizes and both grids basically agree with the exact solution, and no negative values of pressure and density are detected. Positions of the shockwave and contact discontinuity in the finer $N=3200$ grid are significantly closer to the exact solution compared with those in the $N=800$ grid. On both grids, using larger $\mathrm \Delta t_{max}$ produces more oscillations near the shockwave. }}{19}{section*.12}%
\contentsline {added}{Added~(harry): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ Figure \ref {fig:leBlanc1} illustrates history of time step size and density residual in the Le Blanc problem. Using smaller $\mathrm \Delta t_{max}$, the actual $\mathrm \Delta t$ often reaches $\mathrm \Delta t_{max}=0.01$ on both grids. With larger $\mathrm \Delta t_{max}=0.1$, the actual time step $\mathrm \Delta t$ is constrained by the grid size near strong discontinuities. Figure \ref {fig:leBlanc1}(a) shows that smaller grid size imposes smaller time step size upper bound in physical time step size limiting. }}{19}{section*.14}%
\contentsline {added}{Added~(harry): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ In Figure \ref {fig:leBlanc1}(b), the $x$ axis represents total iteration numbers across each stage of each ESDIRK time step. The convergence history shown in Figure \ref {fig:leBlanc1}(b) indicates the residuals reduce rapidly in each stage and step. In a few stages, the residuals struggle to further reduce to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the initial level. Convergence difficulties in these few steps might be the result of oscillations generated in using high order spacial discretization to resolve the extreme discontinuities. }}{19}{section*.15}%
