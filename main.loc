\contentsline {added}{Added~(harry): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ The Le Blanc shock tube problem is a one-dimensional Riemann problem described by the Euler equations and generates an extremely strong shockwave \cite {toro2013riemann}. As a result, the Le Blanc problem is often used as a test case for positivity preserving schemes \cite {hu2013positivity, chan2021positivity, huang2024general}. The initial conditions are listed in Eq.\eqref {eq:leBlancCond}. }}{17}{section*.5}%
\contentsline {added}{Added~(harry): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ The ratio of specific heat is $\gamma = 5/3$. The computational domain is in $[0,9]$, partitioned into $N=800$ or $N=3200$ uniform cells. In each inner iteration, the CFL number for local pseudo time step $\text {CFL}_\tau $ is initiated as $0.5$ and increased gradually up to its maximum $10$ at the 10th iteration. The convergence criterion for inner iteration is that the norm of residual decreases by 3 orders of magnitude. For both the $N=800$ and $3200$ grids, two simulations are performed up to $t=6$ using $\mathrm \Delta t_{max} = 0.01$ and $\mathrm \Delta t_{max} = 0.1$ respectively. }}{18}{section*.6}%
\contentsline {added}{Added~(harry): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ The numerical results of the two simulations are shown in Figure \ref {fig:leBlanc}. It can be observed that the numerical solutions with both time step sizes and both grids basically agree with the exact solution, and no negative values of pressure and density are detected. Positions of the shockwave and contact discontinuity in the finer $N=3200$ grid are significantly closer to the exact solution compared with those in the $N=800$ grid. On both grids, using larger $\mathrm \Delta t_{max}$ produces more oscillations near the shockwave. }}{18}{section*.8}%
\contentsline {added}{Added~(harry): \truncate {\Changestruncatewidth }{ Figure \ref {fig:leBlanc1} illustrates history of time step size and density residual in the Le Blanc problem. Using smaller $\mathrm \Delta t_{max}$, the actual $\mathrm \Delta t$ often reaches $\mathrm \Delta t_{max}=0.01$ on both grids. With larger $\mathrm \Delta t_{max}=0.1$, the actual time step $\mathrm \Delta t$ is constrained by the grid size near strong discontinuities. Figure \ref {fig:leBlanc1}(a) shows that smaller grid size imposes smaller time step size upper bound in physical time step size limiting. The convergence history shown in Figure \ref {fig:leBlanc1}(b) indicates the residuals converge rapidly in each step. In a few steps, the residuals struggle to further reduce to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the initial level. Convergence difficulties in these few steps might be the result of oscillations generated in using high order spacial discretization to resolve the extreme discontinuities. }}{19}{section*.10}%
