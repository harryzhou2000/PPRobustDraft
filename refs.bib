We focus our attention on two-dimensional steady-state problems and present higher order accurate (up to fourth-order) discontinuous finite element solutions on unstructured grids of triangles. In particular we show that, in the presence of curved boundaries, a meaningful high-order accurate solution can be obtained only if a corresponding high-order approximation of the geometry is employed. We present numerical solutions of classical test cases computed with linear, quadratic, and cubic elements which illustrate the versatility of the method and the importance of the boundary condition}

We extend a discontinuous finite element discretization originally considered for hyperbolic systems such as the Euler equations to the case of the Navier–Stokes equations by treating the viscous terms with a mixed formulation. The method combines two key ideas which are at the basis of the finite volume and of the finite element method, the physics of wave propagation being accounted for by means of Riemann problems and accuracy being obtained by means of high-order polynomial approximations within elements. As a consequence the method is ideally suited to compute high-order accurate solution of the Navier–Stokes equations on unstructured grids. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by computing the compressible viscous flow on a flat plate and around a NACA0012 airfoil for several flow regimes using constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic elements.}

  abstract = {A high-order, conservative, yet efficient method named the spectral volume (SV) method is developed for conservation laws on unstructured grids. The concept of a “spectral volume” is introduced to achieve high-order accuracy in an efficient manner similar to spectral element and multidomain spectral methods. Each spectral volume is further subdivided into control volumes, and cell-averaged data from these control volumes are used to reconstruct a high-order approximation in the spectral volume. Then Riemann solvers are used to compute the fluxes at spectral volume boundaries. Cell-averaged state variables in the control volumes are updated independently. Furthermore, total variation diminishing and total variation bounded limiters are introduced in the SV method to remove/reduce spurious oscillations near discontinuities. Unlike spectral element and multidomain spectral methods, the SV method can be applied to fully unstructured grids. A very desirable feature of the SV method is that the reconstruction is carried out analytically, and the reconstruction stencil is always nonsingular, in contrast to the memory and CPU-intensive reconstruction in a high-order k-exact finite volume method. Fundamental properties of the SV method are studied and high-order accuracy is demonstrated for several model problems with and without discontinuities.}

  abstract = {A new, high-order, conservative, and efficient method for conservation laws on unstructured grids is developed. It combines the best features of structured and unstructured grid methods to attain computational efficiency and geometric flexibility; it utilizes the concept of discontinuous and high-order local representations to achieve conservation and high accuracy; and it is based on the finite-difference formulation for simplicity. Universal reconstructions are obtained by distributing unknown and flux points in a geometrically similar manner for all unstructured cells. Placements of these points with various orders of accuracy are given for the triangular elements. Accuracy studies of the method are carried out with the two-dimensional linear wave equation and Burgers’ equation, and each order of accuracy is verified numerically. Numerical solutions of plane electromagnetic waves incident on perfectly conducting circular cylinders are presented and compared with the exact solutions to demonstrate the capability of the method. Excellent agreement has been found. The method is much simpler than the discontinuous Galerkin and spectral volume methods for unstructured grids.}

  abstract = {In this article, a conservative least-squares polynomial reconstruction operator is applied to the discontinuous Galerkin method. In a first instance, piecewise polynomials of degree N are used as test functions as well as to represent the data in each element at the beginning of a time step. The time evolution of these data and the flux computation, however, are then done with a different set of piecewise polynomials of degree M⩾N, which are reconstructed from the underlying polynomials of degree N. This approach yields a general, unified framework that contains as two special cases classical high order finite volume (FV) schemes (N=0) as well as the usual discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method (N=M). In the first case, the polynomial is reconstructed from cell averages, for the latter, the reconstruction reduces to the identity operator. A completely new class of numerical schemes is generated by choosing N≠0 and M>N. The reconstruction operator is implemented for arbitrary polynomial degrees N and M on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes in two and three space dimensions. To provide a high order accurate one-step time integration of the same formal order of accuracy as the spatial discretization operator, the (reconstructed) polynomial data of degree M are evolved in time locally inside each element using a new local continuous space–time Galerkin method. As a result of this approach, we obtain, as a high order accurate predictor, space–time polynomials for the vector of conserved variables and for the physical fluxes and source terms, which then can be used in a natural way to construct very efficient fully-discrete and quadrature-free one-step schemes. This feature is particularly important for DG schemes in three space dimensions, where the cost of numerical quadrature may become prohibitively expensive for very high orders of accuracy. Numerical convergence studies of all members of the new general class of proposed schemes are shown up to sixth-order of accuracy in space and time on unstructured two- and three-dimensional meshes for two very prominent nonlinear hyperbolic systems, namely for the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The results indicate that the new class of intermediate schemes (N≠0,M>N) is computationally more efficient than classical finite volume or DG schemes. Finally, a large set of interesting test cases is solved on unstructured meshes, where the proposed new time stepping approach is applied to the equations of ideal and relativistic MHD as well as to nonlinear elasticity, using a standard high order WENO finite volume discretization in space to cope with discontinuous solutions.}
